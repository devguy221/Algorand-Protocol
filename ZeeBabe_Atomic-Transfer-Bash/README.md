### Overview

An Atomic Transfer is an operation that allows multiple transactions which are compiled as one to either succed or fail as a whole.
On Algorand, atomic transfers are implemented as irreducible batch operations, where a group of transactions are submitted as a unit and all transactions in the batch either pass or fail.

Atomic transfers enable use cases such as:
Circular trades - Alice pays Bob if and only if Bob pays Claire if and only if Claire pays Alice.
Group payments - Everyone pays or no one pays.
Decentralized exchanges - Trade one asset for another without going through a centralized exchange.
Distributed payments - Payments to multiple recipients.
Pooled transaction fees - One transaction pays the fees of others.

### Problems Encountered
