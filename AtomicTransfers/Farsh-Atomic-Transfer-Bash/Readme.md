# FARSH_ATOMIC TRANSFER SUBMISSION

An Atomic Transfer is an operation that allows multiple transactions which are compiled as one to either succed or fail as a whole.
On Algorand, atomic transfers are implemented as irreducible batch operations, where a group of transactions are submitted as a unit and all transactions in the batch either pass or fail.

This Bash execute Atomic transfer that performs Distributed payments i.e Payments to multiple recipients.
