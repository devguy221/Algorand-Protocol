# PERFORMING ATOMIC TRANSFER WITH ALGORAND BLOCKCHAIN 


Atomic transfers allow complete strangers to trade assets without the need for a trusted intermediary, all while guaranteeing that each party will receive what they agreed to.



### RUN STEPS

1. `git clone` this repository

2. `pip install py-algorand-sdk`

3. `cd` into the main.py file in the root directory

4. Input mnemonics for test account 1 and 2 

5. Declare algod connection parameters (token, address)
        This will be your purestake api key and address
