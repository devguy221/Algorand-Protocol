# Atomic Transfer

his simply means that transactions that are part of the transfer either all succeed or all fail. Atomic transfers allow complete strangers to trade assets without the need for a trusted intermediary, all while guaranteeing that each party will receive what they agreed to.

On Algorand, atomic transfers are implemented as irreducible batch operations, where a group of transactions are submitted as a unit and all transactions in the batch either pass or fail. This also eliminates the need for more complex solutions like hashed timelock contracts that are implemented on other blockchains. An atomic transfer on Algorand is confirmed in less than 5 seconds, just like any other transaction. Transactions can contain Algos or Algorand Standard Assets and may also be governed by Algorand Smart Contracts.
