##  Quick Start
It is assumed you already have a working Python environment configured. Next we need to make sure py-algorand-sdk is installed. 

üìÑ Clone or fork ` this repo ` :
```sh
git clone < repo >

#  Install all dependencies: 

cd into your working dir
pip install py-algorand-sdk

‚úè Rename `.env.example` to `.env` in the main folder and provide your `appId` and `serverUrl` from Purestake ([How to get Purestake Server](https://purestake.io)) 
Example:
```jsx
// API server address, port and API token, which you can get from purestake.io
SERVER = ''
PORT = ''
