A Multi-Signature wallet enables transfer and management of funds involving multiple parties. For example, the implementation of a vault type lock with a 2 of 2 wallets requires 2 separate private keys to move funds or more complex approval mechanisms such as 3 signatures of 5 signers requiring any 3 keys out of 5.
