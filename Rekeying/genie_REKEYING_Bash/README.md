# REKEYING WITH ALGORAND

Rekeying is a powerful protocol feature which enables an Algorand account holder to maintain a static public address while dynamically rotating the authoritative private spending key(s). This is accomplished by issuing a "rekey-to transaction" which sets the authorized address field within the account object.
